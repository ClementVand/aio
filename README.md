# AIO

This package provides a ready-to-launch app with all necessary features already implemented.
It also gives you access to many functionalities through the `App()` class. (see [Core](docs/core.md))

## Features

TODO: List what your package can do. Maybe include images, gifs, or videos.

## Getting started

You can either use the package as is and access the functionalities through the `App()` class.

Or you can use the [aio_app_template](https://github.com/ClementVand/aio_app_template) as 
a starting point for your own app to get a better understanding of how everything works.

## Additional information

TODO: Tell users more about the package: where to find more information, how to
contribute to the package, how to file issues, what response they can expect
from the package authors, and more.
